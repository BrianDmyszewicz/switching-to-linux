# Switching to Linux

!!! THIS GUIDE IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

## Introduction

This guide is intended for beginners who don't know anything about Linux (or even computers in general) but are willing to give it a try. It covers and attempts to simplify the choice of one's first Linux distribution, the process of its installation as well as the basic knowledge required to use it, including some major differences between Linux and other operating systems. This guide includes some subjective but necessary simplifications, to eliminate confusion for new users. Existing Linux users wishing to learn much more about their system can instead follow my "Understanding Linux" guide.

## Reasons to use Linux

1. Popular operating systems such as Windows or MacOS violate your freedom, privacy and are easier infected with viruses. Companies behind those systems don't allow anyone to see what goes on behind the scenes, as they involuntarily collect your data and can share it with other companies or governments.

2. Linux is free and open source which means that anyone is able to view and modify the code behind it. This makes it more secure, as people around the world are able to identify and immediately address any problems. It's also more private as it doesn't collect any of your data. Linux allows you to do whatever you want with it, all at the great price of exactly 0 dollars.

3. Contrary to the popular belief, Linux is very simple and user friendly nowadays. As a regular user you'll never have to use the command line. In fact, you might find that Linux causes you less headaches than your previous system, especially if all you do is use the internet browser or occasionally edit some documents.

4. Linux is fast. In fact, it's so fast and lightweight that it can run relatively well on almost anything. Have an old PC or laptop from 10 years ago lying around? Now you can bring a new life into it, installing Linux will likely make it usable again. In fact, installing Linux on a spare computer is the best way to experience it for the first time.

## Necessary Compromises

For an average user, there's very few. It all depends on the devices and programs one commonly uses. If you use a regular PC or laptop with no exotic or specialized peripherals and do most of your work inside the web browser, you'll never even notice you're using a different operating system but for some users, this will not be the case.

Most programs are supported on Linux but there is a bunch that aren't. Generally speaking, everything you might need will at the very least have a good alternative. Adobe doesn't support Linux so unfortunately you won't be able to use Photoshop, but an alternative program called GIMP provides almost all of Photoshop's functionalities and there is even a version of it which mimicks the Photoshop interface. Microsoft Office is also unsupported but perfectly mimicked by OnlyOffice, a fully compatible open source alternative, you'll barely notice a difference. That said, if one relies on those programs professionally, it's probably not a good idea to switch to Linux on their primary workstation.

## Simple Solution

A solution to any compromises is simply installing Linux on a spare computer or hard drive. Doing this will eliminate any stress possibly caused by being forced to quickly adjust to your new system and programs. If you instead take your time with it and treat it as more of a hobby, it'll be a much better experience and if anything ever goes wrong, you'll have nothing to worry about. This also means that you won't have to back up your data like documents or photos, which would be deleted when installing a new operating system. 

I understand that not everyone has a spare computer to work with or has the technical knowledge to change a hard drive but I can't stress enough how important this step is, especially if you're not an advanced computer user in the first place. There's tons of cheap old laptops you can buy used that will be ideal for this purpose and you can always sell them back for the same money at any point.

## How to switch

If you've never installed an operating system before, you might feel intimidated but it's really not that hard. There's going to be a couple important steps that I'll attempt to break down and simplify as much as possible. Instead of presenting a million different options, I will try to suggest sane defaults that should set you on your journey but once you get the hang of using Linux, you'll be able to easily try all the various options it offers. I divided this guide into the following steps:

1. Choose a distribution
2. Create an installation USB
3. Install Linux
4. Basics of using Linux
5. Software alternatives

## 1 Choose a distribution

Linux comes in many flavours, called distributions. As a complete beginner, you should only consider the most popular and user friendly distributions. Perhaps the single biggest factor behind choosing a distribution, will be its desktop environment, which determines the look and feel of your system. There is a couple of available desktops you could choose from, and a handful of popular distributions that offer them. I will narrow the options down for you for now and recommend my favourite, but remember that this choice is not permanent, you can always go back and try them all out in the future. 

Popular beginner-friendly distributions I can recommend:  
- Mint:       best with Cinnamon desktop providing a Windows-like look, ease-of-use and beginner focus  
- Fedora:     comes with Gnome desktop providing a MacOS-like look, new technology and simplicity focus  
- Manjaro:    all major desktops available, very frequent updates, best for "tinkerers" who want to learn  

If you're still unsure what to go with or want to try out even more options, that's fine. You can actually try all of them out by simply installing them on a USB drive. This step is requred for the installation anyway, and it lets you quickly see if you like the general look and feel of the system.

## 2. Create an installation USB

Before you can install the system on your computer, you must download and install it onto a USB drive. There are different ways of doing this depending on what system you're currently using. I'll show one method per platform to keep it simple:
